# Blockchain Voting System üó≥Ô∏è

A decentralized voting system built on Ethereum's Sepolia testnet. This project allows users to vote for their preferred candidate using smart contracts, ensuring transparency and security in the voting process.

## Features
- **Decentralized Voting**: Votes are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Transparency**: All votes are publicly verifiable.
- **Security**: Smart contracts ensure that each address can vote only once.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **Ethereum**: For blockchain and smart contracts.
- **Web3.py**: To interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Streamlit**: For the web interface.
- **Alchemy**: As the Ethereum node provider.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Streamlit (`pip install streamlit`)
- Web3.py (`pip install web3`)
- An Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) with Sepolia testnet ETH.
